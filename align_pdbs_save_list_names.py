# from a directory with pdbs, 
#Â   aligns all pdbs to given reference and saves all pdbs into single (very large file).
#   also saves aligned pdbs into separate files
#   saves a summary csv file with namefile
#   also saves errorfile with files not aligned+saved


# It will align even if not same topology (saving pdbnameal.pdb), but won't add to single large pdb file with all aligned if not exact topology (num chains, name atoms)

## HARDCODED INDICES ALIGN BY GALPHA RAS DOMAIN! from pdbs with deleted GPCRs, sweetener ligands (RES, RebM,...) -- lines 49 and 50

# usage:
#   python align_pdbs_save_list_names.py folder reference.pdb

#   python align_pdbs_save_list_names.py gdpclustering gdpclustering/isorebmPam_dM1open_465588.pdb  

#   - folder is folder of pdbs to align
#       - pdbs need to have chain ID = to ref (= mdtraj topology: # chains, atoms)
#           - if not present, can add from reference (if # atoms is the same) with add_chainid_pdb.py
#   - referencepdb is single pdb structure to serve as reference

# Returns /aligned/ folder with 
#   - aligned individual pdbs
#   - allnames... .txt with names of aligned pdbs
#   - erred... .txt with names of files not aligned bc error
#   - allaligned_... .pdb single file with all pdbs aligned

# Aligned 120 files in 97.98660111427307 seconds, 1 weren't pdbs, 33 erred
